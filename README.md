hello Man

in this commit:
I made a branch were i recreated the \_printf.c that we already did yesterday
I split it to print_c.c that prints charachters, strings and that %
and to a print_d_i.c that prints intigers and i made the negative intigers
works as well. the code looks reallu hillarius i dont even know what im doing
but it works. im waiting for ur feedback.

2nd commit:

in thiscommit i figured out how to convert intigers to:
binary numbers i call it the file print_b.c
octal decimal hexa and HEXA i call it print_u_o_x_X.c
